_If you look at the metadata in other websites, you may see a meta tag with the name yandex-verification. Here's what it means._

## What is Yandex? 

According to Wikipedia, [Yandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex) is a Russia based company that owns [Yandex Search](https://yandex.com/). The meta tag _yandex-verification_ refers to Yandex Search.

## What does yandex-verification do?

`yandex-verification` is much like [google-site-verification](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080). `yandex-verification`s confirms you are the webmaster of your website for [Yandex Search](https://yandex.com/).

## How can I add yandex-verfication to my website?

Yandex provides [webmaster tools](https://webmaster.yandex.com/welcome/). These tools help you add your site and receive your verification code. You then place the code in the yandex-verification meta tag for confirmation. 

## How I Add yandex-verification in Next.js 

To add the yandex-verification meta tag in Next.js, I add the following to the `metadata` object in my `layout.tsx` file: 

```tsx 
// app/layout.tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next'

// rest of my layout.tsx file here...

export const metadata: Metadata = {
    // rest of my metadata object here... 
    verification: {
        google: "YOUR-VERIFICATION-CODE-PROVIDED-BY-GOOGLE",
        yandex: "YOUR-VERIFICATION-CODE-PROVIDED-BY-YANDEX",
    },
}
```
Don't worry if you haven't added a `google-site-verification` code to your website. I show how in my [_How to Submit Your Sitemap_](https://www.davegray.codes/posts/nextjs-how-to-submit-your-sitemap) article. 

## The Result 

You should now have a `yandex-verification` meta tag inside the `<head>` section of your website. 

Here's the meta tag from my website: 

```html 
<meta name="yandex-verification" content="YOUR-VERIFICATION-CODE-PROVIDED-BY-YANDEX">
```
